-Redo the entire transaction class and related
	1) Add the transaction methods to the wallets
	2) Create ID, Sign TX, etc whould take a pointer to a transaction objects, and return a bool if it was sucessful
	3) Transaction pools and associated fees
		a) The total coinbase amnt has to be equal to the current block reward + fees as provided by the current block (fees are transmitted to the TransactionID)
			i) "342BLOCKFEE" is the "value" transmitted. It is officially "lost" on the chain but is verifiable to be apart of that coinbase transaction as it is addressed to the TransactionID

-Test the transactions on the blockchain

-Create core functionality as a wallet
	1) Create a GUI interface that makes use of the library in its entirety
	2) Make methods for nodes to find each other on the network; whether these are mining pools or other core wallets
	3) Create methods to transmit signed transactions to all known nodes

-Each wallet has the ability to mine, provided it is a core wallet. This will not be an efficient miner, but it wil help to get the coin moving. Efficieny to be built later

-Definitly create a roadmap and white paper soon
